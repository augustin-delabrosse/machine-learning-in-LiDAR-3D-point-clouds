# machine-learning-in-LiDAR-3D-point-clouds

This project is an implementation of the paper of F. Patricia Medina & Randy Paffenroth, [machine-learning-in-LiDAR-3D-point-clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.09318)

I used IGN (French National Geographic Institute) [LidarHD data](https://geoservices.ign.fr/lidarhd) from CÃ´tes d'Armor (West of France).

For this short project, I went through the following steps :
- Exploration of the dataset
- Preprocessing of a sample of the dataset (500 000 points) and feature engineering like described by F. P. Medina et al. (including nearest neighbors concatenation, sdandard scaling, normalizing and dimension reduction with PCA)
- Training and evaluating of a Random Forest Classifier model
- Training and evaluating of a simple two-layer deep neural network model

The random forest seems to perform better than the neural network while the results in the paper show the contrary. This difference may be explained by different reasons :
- My dataset and theirs are different
- F. P. Medina et al. use the features return_number and number_of_returns while In my dataset, I have nan values for these features. It could be interesting to study the impact of the different features on the prediction.


I noted an important effect of the unbalance of the dataset so I tried to undersample dominant categories. I happens that it has an overall negative effect on the main metrics (precision, recall, f1) for both the random forest and the neural network. 

Please note that this projet was a simple way for me to get a better understanding of the Lidar data so I did not try all the things they tried (for instance deep auto-encoder to do dimension reduction as it was indicated that it performed worse than PCA)
